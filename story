--- story ---
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree, which
was on the banks of a river. In the same forest there lived a crocedile and his wife. 
One day, the crocedile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
The kink hearted monkey offerd him some fruits. 
The crocedile came back the next day for some more fruits, as he loved them. As days 
passed by, the crocedile and monkey became friends.
